# CTB-Editor
An editor for osu ctb made in Unity (WIP)

If you want to tinker with the code you need Unity 2018.1.4f1. Later versions are not guaranteed to work.

# Contributing
The editor is at a very early stage of development so it's open for suggestions and it's relatively easy to join the dev team.
We have a discord where you can ask anything from features request to pull requests.
